## 1. INTRODUCTION

a. The purpose of this paper is to characterize simple sabotage, to outline its possible effects, and to present
suggestions for inciting and executing it.

b. Sabotage varies from highly technical coup de main acts that require detailed planning and the use of specially
trained operatives, to innumerable simple acts which the ordinary individual citizen-saboteur can perform. This paper is
primarily concerned with the latter type. Simple sabotage does not require specially prepared tools or equipment; it is
executed by an ordinary citizen who may or may not act individually and without the necessity for active connection with
an organized group; and it is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury, detection, and
reprisal.

c. Where destruction is involved, the weapons of the citizen-saboteur are salt, nails, candles, pebbles, thread, or any
other materials he might normally be expected to
possess as a householder or as a worker in his particular occupation. His arsenal is the kitchen shelf, the trash pile,
his own usual kit of tools and supplies. The targets of his sabotage are usually objects to which he has normal and
inconspicuous access in everyday life.

d. A second type of simple sabotage requires no destructive tools whatsoever and produces physical damage, if any, by
highly indirect means. It is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions, to adopt a non-cooperative
attitude, and to induce others to follow suit. Making a faulty decision may be simply a matter of placing tools in one
spot instead of another. A non-cooperative attitude may involve nothing more than creating an
unpleasant situation among one's fellow workers, engaging in bickerings, or displaying surliness and stupidity.

e. This type of activity, sometimes referred to as the "human clement," is frequently responsible for accidents, delays,
and general obstruction eveb under normal conditions. The potential saboteur should discover what types of faulty
decisions and non-cooperation are normally found in his kind of work and should then devise his sabotage so as to
enlarge that "margin for error."

## 2. POSSIBLE EFFECTS

a. Acts of simple sabotage are occuring throughout Europe. An effort should be made to add to their efficiency, lessen
their detectability, and increase their number. Acts of simple sabotage, mulitiplied by thousands of citizen-saboteurs,
can be an effective weapon against the enemy. Slashing tires, draining fuel tanks, starting fires, starting arguments,
acting stupidly, short-circuiting electric systems, abrading machine parts will waste materials, manpower, and time.
Occuring on a wide scale, simple sabotage will be a constant and tangible drag on the war effort of the enemy.

b. Simple sabotage may also have secondary results of more or less value. Widespread practice of simple sabotage will
harass and demoralize enemy administrators and police. Further, success may embolden the citizen-saboteur eventually to
find colleagues who can assist him in sabotage of greater dimensions. Finally, the very practice of simple sabotage by
natives in enemy or occupied territory may make these individuals identify themselves actively with the United Nations
war effort, and encourage them to assist openly in periods of Allied invasion and occupation.

## 3. MOTIVATING THE SABOTEUR

a. To incite the citizen to the active practice of simple sabotage and to keep him practicing that sabotage over
sustained periods is a special problem.

b. Simple sabotage is often an act which the citizen performs according to his own initiative and inclination. Acts of
destruction do not bring him any personal gain and may be completely foreign to his habitually conservationist attitude
toward materials and tools. Purposeful stupidity is contrary to human nature. He frequently needs pressure, stimulation
or assurance, and information and suggestions regarding feasible methods of simple sabotage.

### (1) Personal Motives

(a) The ordinary citizen very probably has no immediate personal motive for committing simple sabotage. Instead, he must
be made to anticipate indirect personal gain, such as might come with enemy evacuation or destruction of the ruling
government group. Gains should be stated as specifically as possible for the area addressed: simple sabotage will hasten
the day when Commissioner X and his deputies Y and Z will be thrown out, when particularly obnoxious decrees and
restrictions will be abolished, when food will arrive, and so on. Abstract verbalizations about personal liberty,
freedom of the press, and so on, will not be convincing in most parts of the world. In many areas they will not even be
comprehensible.

(b) Since the effect of his own acts is limited, the saboteur may become discouraged unless he feels that he is a member
of a large, though unseen, group of saboteurs operating against the enemy or the government of his own country and
elsewhere. This can be conveyed indirectly: suggestions which he reads and hears can include observations that a
particular technique has been successful in this or that district. Even if the technique is not applicable to his
surroundings, another's success will encourage him to attempt similar acts. It also can be conveyed directly: statements
praising the effectiveness of simple sabotage can be contrived which will be published by white radio, freedom stations,
and the subversive press. Estimates of the proportion of the population engaged in sabotage can be disseminated.
Instances of successful sabotage already are being broadcast by white radio and freedom stations, and this should be
continued and expanded where compatible with security.

(c) More important than (a) or (b) would be to create a situation in which the citizen-saboteur acquires a sense of
responsibility and begins to educate others in simple sabotage.

### (2) Encouraging Destructiveness

It should be pointed out to the saboteur where the circumstances are suitable, that he is acting in self-defense against
the enemy, or retaliating against the enemy for other acts of destruction. A reasonable amount of humor in the
presentation of suggestions for simple sabotage will relax tension of fear.

(a) The saboteur may have to reverse his thinking, and he should be told this in so many words. Where he formerly
thought of keeping his tools sharp, he should now let them grow dull; surfaces that formerly were lubricated now should
be sanded; normally diligent, he should now be lazy and careless; and so on. Once he is encouraged to think backwards
about himself and the objects of his everyday life, the saboteur will see many opportunities in his immediate
environment which cannot possibly be seen from a distance. A state of mind should be encouraged that anything can be
sabotaged.

(b) Among the potential citizen-saboteurs who are to engage in physical destruction, two extreme types may be
distinguished. On the one hand, there is the man who is not technically trained and employed. This man needs specific
suggestions as to what he can and should destroy as well as details regarding the tools by means of which destruction is
accomplished.

(c) At the other extreme is the man who is a technician, such as a lathe operator or an automobile mechanic. Presumably
this man would be able to devise methods of simple sabotage which would be appropriate to his own facilities. However,
this man needs to be stimulated to re-orient his thinking in the direction of destruction. Specific examples, which need
not be from his own field, should accomplish this.

(d) Various media may be used to disseminate suggestions and information regarding simple sabotage. Among the media
which may be used, as the immediate situation dictates, are: freedom stations or radio, false or official leaflets.
Broadcasts or leaflets may be directed toward specific geographic or occupational areas, or they may be general in
scope. Finally, agents may be trained in the art of simple sabotage, in anticipation of a time when they may be able to
communicate this information directly.

### (3) Safety Measures

(a) The amount of activity carried on by the saboteur will be governed not only by the number of opportunities he sees,
but also by the amount of danger he feels. Bad news travels fast, and simple sabotage will be discouraged if too many
simple saboteurs are arrested.

(b) It should not be difficult to prepare leaflets and other media for the saboteur about the choice of weapons, time,
and targets which will insure the saboteur against detection and retaliation. Among such suggestions might be the
following:

(1) Use materials which appear to be innocent. A knife or a nail file can be carried normally on your person; either is
a multi-purpose instrument for creating damage. Matches, pebbles, hair, salt, nails, and dozens of other destructive
agents can be carried or kept in your living quarters without exciting any suspicion whatever. If you are a worker in a
particular trade or industry you can easily carry and keep such things as wrenches, hammers, emery paper, and the like.

(2) Try to commit acts for which large numbers of people could be responsible. For instance, if you blow out the wiring
in a factory at a central fire box, almost anyone could have done it. On-the-street sabotage after dark, such as you
might be able to carry out against a military car or truck, is another example of an act for which it would be
impossible to blame you.

(3) Do not be afraid to commit acts for which you might be blamed directly, so long as you have a plausible excuse: you
dropped your wrench across an electric circuit because an air raid had kept you up the night before and you were
half-dozing at work. Always be profused in your apologies. Frequently you can "get away" with such acts under the cover
of pretending stupidity, ignorance, over-caution, fear of being suspected of sabotage, or weakness and dullness due to
undernourishment.

(4) After you have committed an act of easy sabotage, resist any temptation to wait around and see what happens.
Loiterers arouse suspicion. Of course, there are circumstances when it would be suspisious for you to leave. If you
commit a sabotage on your job, you should naturally stay at your work.

### (10) Electric Power

### (11) General Interference with Organizations and Production

#### (a) Organizations and Conferences

(1) Insist on doing everything through "channels." Never permit short-cuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions.

(2) Make "speeches." Talk as frequently as possible and at great length. Illustrate your "points" by long anecdotes
and accounts of personal experiences. Never hesitate to make a few appropriate "patriotic" comments.

(3) When possible, refer all matters to committees, for "further study and consideration." Attempt to make the
committees as large as possible - never less than five.

(4) Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.

(5) Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions.

(6) Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt to re-open the question of the advisability of
that decision,

(7) Advocate "caution." Be "reasonable" and urge your fellow-conferees to be "reasonable" and avoid haste which might
result in embarrassments or difficulties later on.

(8) Be worried about the propriety of any decision - raise the question of whether such action as is contemplated lies
within the jurisdiction of the group or whether it might conflict with the policy of some higher echelon.

#### (b) Managers and Supervisors

(1) Demand written orders.

(2) "Misunderstand" orders. Ask endless questions or engage in long correspondence about such orders. Quibble over them
when you can.

(3) Do everything possible to delay the delivery of orders. Even though parts of an order may be ready beforehand, don't
deliver it until it is completely ready.

(4) Don't order new working materials until your current stocks have been virtually exhausted, so that the slightest
delay in filling your order will mean a shutdown.

(5) Order high-quality materials which are hard to get. If you don't get them argue about it. Warn that inferior
materials will mean inferior work.

(6) In making work assignments, always sign out the unimportant jobs first. See that the important jobs are assigned to
inefficient workers of poor machines.

(7) Insist on perfect work in relatively unimportant products; send back for refinishing those which have the least
flaw. Approve other defective parts whose flaws are not visible to the naked eye.

(8) Make mistakes in routing so that parts and materials will be sent to the wrong place in the plant.

(9) When training new workers, give incomplete or misleading instructions.

(10) To lower morale and with it, production, be pleasant to inefficient workers; give them undeserved promotions.
Discriminate against efficient workers; complain unjustly about their work.

(11) Hold conferences when there is more critical work to be done.

(12) Multiply paper work in plausible ways. Start duplicate files.

(13) Multiply the procedures and clearances involved in issuing instructions, pay checks, and so on. See that three
people have to approve everything where one would do.

(14) Apply all regulations to the last letter.

### (12) General Devices for Lowering Morale and Creating Confusion

- (a) Give lengthy and incomprehensible explanations when questioned.
- (b) Report imaginary spies or danger to the Gestapo or police
- (c) Act stupid.
- (d) Be as irritable and quarrelsome as possible without getting yourself into trouble.
- (e) Misunderstand all sorts of regulations concerning such matters as rationing, transportation, traffic regulations.
- (f) Complain against ersatz materials.
- (g) In public treat axis nationals or quislings coldly
- (h) stop all conversation when axis nationals or quislings enter a cafe.
- (i) Cry and sob hysterically at every occasion, especially when confronted by government clerks.
- (j) Boycott all movies, entertainments, concerts, newspapers which are in any way connected with the quisling
  authorities.
- (k) Do not cooperate in salvage schemes.
